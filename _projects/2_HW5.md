# Building Inventory Analysis Dashboard

This project presents an interactive dashboard analyzing the Illinois government building inventory dataset using Python, Altair, and Vega-Lite visualizations.

## Visualization 1: Building Space Distribution Analysis

<vegachart schema-url="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/json/building_analysis1_subset.json" style="width: 100%"></vegachart>

This linked visualization explores the relationship between building square footage distribution across government agencies and their construction timelines. 

**Visual Encoding:**
- **Left Heatmap**: Position encoding on both axes with color encoding showing building concentration by size and agency
- **Right Histogram**: Length encoding for building counts with dynamic filtering based on heatmap selections

**Data Processing:**
- Cleaned dataset by removing records with missing construction years or square footage values
- Binned square footage into 10 quantile-based groups for better distribution visualization
- Implemented interactive brushing to connect agency-size patterns with construction timelines

**Insights**: Reveals how different government agencies constructed facilities of various sizes during different historical periods.

## Visualization 2: Building Status and Geographic Analysis

<vegachart schema-url="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/json/building_analysis2_subset.json" style="width: 100%"></vegachart>

This dashboard examines building status categories and their geographic distribution across Illinois counties.

**Visual Encoding:**
- **Left Stacked Bar Chart**: Length encoding for total square footage with color encoding by usage type
- **Right Scatter Plot**: Position encoding for construction year and county, with size and color encoding

**Data Processing:**
- Aggregated square footage by status and usage categories
- Calculated summary statistics for county-agency combinations  
- Created derived age categories to identify historical building patterns

**Insights**: Interactive linking enables exploration of how building status correlates with geographic distribution and construction eras, helping identify regional infrastructure patterns.

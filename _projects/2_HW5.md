# Building Inventory Analysis Dashboard

This project presents an interactive dashboard analyzing the Illinois government building inventory dataset using Python, Altair, HTML, and Vega-Lite visualizations.

## Visualization 1: Building Space Distribution Analysis

<vegachart schema-url="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/json/building_analysis1_subset.json" style="width: 100%"></vegachart>

This visualization explores relationships between Pennsylvania state-owned buildings’ size, agency affiliation, and year of construction. The heatmap on the left summarizes how building square footage is distributed across different state agencies. Square Footage (quantitative) is placed on the x-axis. The y-axis shows Agency Name as an ordinal category so viewers can quickly see which agencies tend to manage larger or smaller buildings. Color scale is used to represent count, where darker shades correspond to a higher number of buildings. 

The bar chart on the right provides context on when these buildings were constructed. Year Constructed is binned on the x-axis, and the height of the bars reflects the number of buildings built within each time range.The square footage and year constructed fields were binned during the data transformation stage to group values into ranges thus able to do comparison across agencies.

## Visualization 2: Building Status and Geographic Analysis

<vegachart schema-url="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/json/building_analysis2_subset.json" style="width: 100%"></vegachart>

This visualization examines how building status relates to total square footage and how these buildings are distributed across counties and construction years. The bar chart on the left aggregates the total square footage by building status (for example, Active vs. Inactive). Building Status is shown on the x-axis as a nominal category, while the y-axis displays the sum of Square Footage. Color encodes Usage Description, which allows viewers to see how different types of buildings contribute to each status category. The tooltip provides precise values for further detail.

The scatterplot on the right visualizes when and where these buildings were constructed. Year Constructed is mapped to the x-axis and County to the y-axis (ordinal). Point size encodes Square Footage, larger circles represent larger buildings. Color represents Agency Name, helping identify which agencies are responsible for specific buildings across counties and time periods.

Before creating this visualization, I created a subset of the dataset that included only the variables relevant to the analysis (Agency Name, County, Year Constructed, Square Footage, Usage Description, and Building Status).
